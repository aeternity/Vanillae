# The Vanillae Files

My name is Peter Harpending.  I'm one of the two developers of the Vanillae
Project (other: Craig Everett).

Craig and I started by trying to create a simple e-commerce website that used
Aeternity as its payment system.  We are also currently developing a wallet.
We have run into many weird stupid technical pitfalls or weird things you have
to learn about that take like 8 hours but really are 1 hour of complexity.
This file tree documents the ones we cared to write about.

Most of these have code examples in Erlang and/or TypeScript.

- [How to install NPM without getting AIDS](./npm-misc/)
- [Base64 versus Base58 with code in Erlang and TypeScript](./baseN/)
- [Ethereum Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) Encoding, with code in Erlang and TypeScript](./rlp/)
