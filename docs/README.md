# The Vanillae Files

My name is Peter Harpending.  I'm one of the two developers of the Vanillae
Project (other: Craig Everett).

Craig and I started by trying to create a simple e-commerce website that used
Aeternity as its payment system.  We are also currently developing a wallet.
We have run into many weird stupid technical pitfalls or weird things you have
to learn about.  This file tree documents the ones we cared to write about.
