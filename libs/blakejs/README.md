# blakejs

This is the [blakejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blakejs) library adapted
for [the jex package manager](../../utils/jex).

I (Peter) only included the subset of blake which is actually used, the blake2b
module.  The package is modified to "just work" with the ES6 module system.

For internal use in Jack Russell
