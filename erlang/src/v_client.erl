%%% Vanillae for Erlang Client
%%%
%%% An extremely naive (currently Telnet) client handler.
%%% Unlike other modules that represent discrete processes, this one does not adhere
%%% to any OTP behavior. It does, however, adhere to OTP.
%%%
%%% In some cases it is more comfortable to write socket handlers or a certain
%%% category of state machines as "pure" Erlang processes. This approach is made
%%% OTP-able by use of the proc_lib module, which is the underlying library used
%%% to write the stdlib's behaviors like gen_server, gen_statem, gen_fsm, etc.
